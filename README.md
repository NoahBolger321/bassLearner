# bassLearner
Read bass tabs, learn key and generate riffs

## Purpose/Goal
The goal of this project is to create a tool that can process and analyze bass tabs in an analytic way, with the purpose of extracting, predicting and building bass lines from simple parameters.

## Components

- string mapping that maps a fret on a string to a musical note
- tab reader that extractys notes from tab sequentially
- counter that records frequency of each note in the tab
- key mapping that maps a musical key to a list of notes
- key determination that can determine or guess the key from a bass tab
